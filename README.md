## Study Overview

This study evaluates the physico-chemical characteristics of the Mogral River and computes the Water Quality Index (WQI) to assess its suitability for human use.

The Mogral River is a west-flowing river in Kasaragod district, Kerala, India, with a length of approximately **34 km** and a drainage area of about **132 km²**.

## Sampling Design

Water samples were collected from **24 stations along the Mogral River basin** during:

- January 2021
- February 2021

## Water Quality Parameters

The following physico-chemical parameters were analysed:

- Temperature
- pH
- Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
- Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)
- Chloride
- Alkalinity

## Water Quality Index Method

The **Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index (WQI)** method proposed by **Horton (1965)** was used.

The index integrates multiple water quality parameters into a single indicator representing the overall condition of the river water.

## Key Findings

- Most upstream locations showed **good water quality**.
- Downstream locations showed **very high chloride concentrations**, indicating **saline intrusion near the estuarine region**.
- Some stations exhibited **poor to very poor water quality**, mainly due to anthropogenic activities.
