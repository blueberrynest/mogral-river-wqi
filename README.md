## Study Overview

This study evaluates the physico-chemical characteristics of the Mogral River and computes the Water Quality Index (WQI) to assess its suitability for human use.

The Mogral River is a west-flowing river located in Kasaragod district, Kerala, India.  
It has an approximate length of **34 km** and a drainage area of **132 km²**.

The river basin supports agriculture, domestic water use, and local livelihoods. Increasing anthropogenic pressures such as domestic waste discharge, agricultural runoff, and sand mining have raised concerns regarding water quality.

The study integrates multiple physico-chemical parameters into a single indicator — the **Water Quality Index (WQI)** — to evaluate the overall condition of the river.

---

## Sampling Design

Water samples were collected from **24 sampling stations (S1–S24)** distributed along the Mogral River basin.

Sampling period:

- January 2021
- February 2021

Grab sampling techniques were used and laboratory analysis was conducted following standard procedures.

---

## Water Quality Parameters

The following physico-chemical parameters were analysed:

- Temperature
- pH
- Dissolved Oxygen (DO)
- Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)
- Chloride
- Alkalinity

The results were compared with standards prescribed by:

- Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)
- Surface water quality criteria

## Water Quality Index Method

The **Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index (WQI)** method proposed by **Horton (1965)** was used to compute water quality.

This method:

1. Assigns a **weight to each water quality parameter**
2. Converts measured values to **quality ratings**
3. Aggregates them into a **single index value**

Water quality classification used in the study:

-----------------------------------------------
| WQI Range | Water Quality           | Grade |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------|
| 0 – 25    | Excellent               | A     |
| 26 – 50   | Good                    | B     |
| 51 – 75   | Poor                    | C     |
| 76 – 100  | Very Poor               | D     |
| >100      | Unsuitable for drinking | E     |
-----------------------------------------------

## Key Findings

The analysis of water samples showed the following trends:

- Most upstream locations exhibited **good water quality**.
- Several midstream locations showed **moderate deterioration**.
- Downstream locations near the estuarine region recorded **extremely high chloride concentrations**, indicating **saline intrusion**.
- Certain stations showed **poor to very poor water quality**, primarily due to anthropogenic activities and sewage entry.

The results highlight the need for **continuous monitoring and improved waste management practices in the river basin**.
